# Pickpocket
A [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW) (1.12) addon which displays if a mob has been pickpocketed on mouseover.

## Known Bugs

* Pickpocked state will never reset by itself. Use `/pp reset` or `/pickpocket reset` to manually reset.
* If pickpocketing fails for whatever reason (out of range, resist, not in stealth etc.) the target will still be marked as being pickpocketed.
